## Releases

Each release should contain an Epic for each Component to be worked on in the release.

Each Epic should have:

1. Summary: This should be the Component name followed by the Release name.
2. Name: A short version of the summary, use abbreviations where available.
3. Description: 
  - The features defined in the roadmap copied across
  - A high level overview of the functionality to be implemented during the release. This description should be defined either by the architect or component lead.

The component lead should then create child Issues of the Epic to break the work required down in to manageable chunks that can be completed in the release sprints.

Do not add Issues directly to Releases unless they are not part of any component.
